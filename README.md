# bunny-walkthrough

A "hello world" example of sorts for using [stack.gl](http://stack.gl/):
simply draws a 3D bunny to the screen with an orbit camera for interacting
with.

Thoroughly verbose comments here, to step through the basics of how everything
fits together in practice.

To run this locally, ensure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
[git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, then run the following from your terminal:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:stackgl/bunny-walkthrough
cd bunny-walkthrough
npm install
npm start
```
